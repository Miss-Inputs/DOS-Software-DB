A database of DOS games intended to be parseable by computers, and I guess humans if they really wanted to, in order to help launchers and frontends and things and basically it's just here for Meow Launcher to use.  

See format.txt for what the entries should look like.  

WARNING: This is under construction and not really ready yet until I've migrated like every entry from ComputerGameDB. Until then I'm allowed to change the schema without updating the version because I said so.
